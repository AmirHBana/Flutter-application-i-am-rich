<h3> I'm rich app history </h3>

<hr>

<p> I Am Rich is a 2008 mobile app for iPhones which had minimal function and was priced at US$999.99 (equivalent to $1,359 in 2022).<br><br>
  The app was pulled from the App Store less than 24 hours after its launch. Receiving poor reviews from critics, only eight copies were sold.<br><br>
  In the years since, several similar applications have been released at lower prices.<br>

  <hr>

  I Am Rich was developed as a joke by German software developer, Armin Heinrich, after he saw iPhone users complaining about software priced above $.99.
